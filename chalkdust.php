  tinanong mo ako kung ano plan ko para sa thesis namin. I said we'll be using
  .NET then you smiled at me and replied  \"Eh alam mo na ang Java at .NET, 
  bakit hindi mo kaya subukan ang PHP!\". That day, I accepted your challenge.";

  to appreciate the IT world. You will forever be missed. Rest in peace sir!";
